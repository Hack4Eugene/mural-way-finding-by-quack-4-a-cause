# Mural Way Finding - Quack For A Cause


### Challenge:
The challenge we decided to take on was the Mural Way Finding challenge. The purpose of this challenge was to aid those in finding interesting murals around Eugene.

### Our solution: [Quack4ACause.pythonanywhere.com](quack4acause.pythonanywhere.com)
We decided to make a responsive, mobile-friendly web application to provice users the most convenient way to learn about local art culture, especially Eugene Murals.


### Plans for expansion:
We built this to be easily scalable to larger applications for different cities to showcase their rich culture and diversity. This was built for Eugene murals, but really coudl be used for a more general web application. This build was made for the 2018 Eugene Hack For A Cause.
